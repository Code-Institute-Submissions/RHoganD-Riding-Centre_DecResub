# The purpose with this project
The Riding Centre is a family business that loves horses and wants to encourage and share with the community who may not yet know anything about the horses and the gratifying experience that this represents.
This site will target individuals who have not yet tried to ride a horse and might be looking for information on how to book a riding session or learn how to ride a horse.
>Horses generate empathy with humans that other animals do not.
The live site can be found here -[Riding Center](https://rhogand.github.io/Riding-Centre/)

# Design 

Some of the features of the design have been inspired by  The Love  Running Projects. The code for the footer and hero image has been taken from that project.
The scheme colour selected is based on the hero image. The scheme colour has a similarity to the colour found on the hero image and the logo. To create the website with a sense of harmony while navigating.
I have aimed to create a clean-looking website with a balance between colours, images and functionality.

## Existing Features

## Navigation Bar
The Header consists of a logo and text created with photoshop.
The image for the logo was downloaded from: https://stock.adobe.com/uk. 
The logo is aligned to the right, and the Navigation bar or menu is aligned to the left.

## Home
This is the first part of a website the user will see when visiting.  
Designed to be welcoming and informative. Full hero image to welcome the user and give a clear idea of what the website is all about. 

In the middle of the image, we have the Book Now button that will take the user to the booking page.

Below the image, we will find the about section with a welcoming text and information about the riding centre. Where it explains who we are and the aim.

The home provides an informative video on how to ride a horse step by step for the first time. Along with other information as in the images below

 Followed with information on activities that can be performed with horses  and the community image with like to the British horse Society inviting the user to be part of this community  https://www.bhs.org.uk/ 
 Also, provide a footer with the links to the different social networks.

 ## Booking
 The booking page provided a detailed questionary about the rider and the  cost and duration of the training session. The user to choose how long the first section will last.

 ## Gallery
 The page provides a display of the wonderful memories of the different activities taken place with the horse, either jumping, hacking or just those beautiful moments with the family. The images will zoom in when hover it.

 ## Contact
The contact form was designed with the help of the Youtube videos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12Y007Pm0v0
 The shape of an open book,  shadows and padding of the border create the illusion of 3D.
The form shares the same characteristics as the booking page, only differing in the input fields. The idea of the contact form is to provide the user with an alternative way to contact the Riding Centre and request additional information if needed.
